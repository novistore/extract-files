Reversibly extracts files from an object tree.

Files are extracted along with their object path to allow reassembly. Extracted files are removed from the tree. Array item files are removed without reindexing the array to simplify reassembly.

Files may be [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/File) and [`ReactNativeFile`](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files#react-native) instances. [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FileList) instances are converted to arrays and the items are extracted as `File` instances.

## Usage

Install with [npm](https://npmjs.com):

```
npm install extract-files
```

`extractFiles` accepts an object tree to extract files from, along with an optional tree path to prefix file paths:

```js
import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files'
import tree from './tree'

const files = extractFiles(tree, 'tree')
```

Extracted files are an array:

```js
[{
  path: 'tree.foo',
  file: /* File instance */
}, {
  path: 'tree.bar.0',
  file: /* File instance */
}, {
  path: 'tree.bar.1',
  file: /* File instance */
}]
```

`extractFiles` will return an empty array if the object tree is `null` or not an object. The top tree node must not be a file.

### React Native

React Native [polyfills FormData](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/v0.45.1/Libraries/Network/FormData.js) under the hood and objects with the properties `uri`, `type` and `name` substitute `window.File`. It would be risky to assume all objects with those properties in a tree are files. Use `ReactNativeFile` instances within a tree to explicitly mark files:

```js
import { extractFiles, ReactNativeFile } from 'extract-files'

const tree = {
  singleFile: new ReactNativeFile({
    uri: uriFromCameraRoll,
    type: 'image/jpeg',
    name: 'photo.jpg'
  }),
  multipleFiles: ReactNativeFile.list([{
    uri: uriFromCameraRoll1,
    type: 'image/jpeg',
    name: 'photo-1.jpg'
  }, {
    uri: uriFromCameraRoll2,
    type: 'image/jpeg',
    name: 'photo-2.jpg'
  }])
}

const files = extractFiles(tree, 'tree')
```

### Reassembly

`object-path` can be used to loop and reinsert the extracted files:

```js
import { extractFiles } from 'extract-files'
import objectPath from 'object-path'
import tree from './tree'

const files = extractFiles(tree, 'tree')
const treePath = objectPath(tree)

files.forEach(({path, file}) => treePath.set(path, file))
```

`FileList` instances in an original tree become arrays when reassembled.
